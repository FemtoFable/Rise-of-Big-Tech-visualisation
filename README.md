# Rise-of-Big-Tech-visualisation
A python visualisation of the rise of Big Tech firms over 20 years using plotly and matplotlib 

This visualisation has been built with python. The code is inside a Jupyter Notebook file.
This Jupyter Notebook is designed to be run in Google Colab and uses the following Python packages:

kaleido 
pandas 
plotly.express 
plotly.graph_objs 
plotly.io 
base64 
io 
PIL 
matplotlib.pyplot 
matplotlib.ticker 

kaleido is not included in a default Colab installation and has to be installed.
If an error occurs with kaleido, the Colab runtime needs to be restarted.

It also requires the 3 .csv files and 5 .png files located in the appropriately named folder to be in the Content directory.

fortune500.csv is the original dataset file obtained from:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/darinhawley/fortune-500-companies-19552021

Other datasets, which the visualisation uses, are based on it.
